# Simone Teglia

Hi I’m Simone Teglia, graduated in computer science and currently enrolled in a M.sc. in engineering in computer science at Sapienza University of Rome. My main interests are Machine Learning, Deep learning and Natural Language Processing. 
I'm also a ReactJs enjoyer, I've developed lots of websites both for fun, university projects and work. The last website I've been working on is the official website of [TedxSapienzaU](https://www.tedxsapienzau.com/)
In my free time I play football⚽️ and beach volley🏐
